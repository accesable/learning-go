In Gin, the validation of incoming request payloads is handled automatically when using the ShouldBindJSON method (or any of the ShouldBind methods like ShouldBindQuery, ShouldBindForm, etc.). This automatic validation works because Gin uses the binding package, which integrates with the validator package from the github.com/go-playground/validator/v10 library.
